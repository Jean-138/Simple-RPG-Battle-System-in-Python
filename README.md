# Simple RPG Battle System in Python

This is a simple turn-based RPG battle system developed in Python.  
The project was built as part of learning exercises during a programming course.

How It Works

- The player starts at level 1 with basic stats.
- Multiple monsters (NPCs) are generated with increasing levels.
- The player and an NPC take turns attacking each other.
- If the player wins, they earn XP.
- When the player gains enough XP, they level up, increasing max HP and XP needed for next level.
- The player and NPCs are fully healed between battles.

## How to Run

1. Python 3 installed.
2. Clone this repository or download the `main.py` file.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
